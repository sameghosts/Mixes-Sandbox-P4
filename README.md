# Project 4 - Music Playlist and Mix Application

## Name: 'Mixes Sandbox'

## Goal
This project is an attempt to begin a proof of concept project for post-cohort. This project is an attempt at building a monorep (mono repository) fulll stack application using MongoDB, Express, Apollo, GraphQL, and React. The application in its current form is mostly back-end server side. After a few more queries and mutations are defined, it will be ready to wired to the React front-end. 

The app in its first form will simply allow users to create an account, create a "mixlist" or playlist, and populate this mix with tracks / songs with information entered from client side with a Bandcamp or Discogs URI. 

Using a Open Graph Protocol scraper and parser, from this URI information and resources can be populated on the front end. 

Finally, using both the Discogs API and a Bandcamp Scrape, search features will be built in for users that don't have the URI/URL on hand. 

In its final form, the standard browser will be linked with a chrome extension and a phone app that allows for easy sharing of a bandcamp or discogs page directly to a mix you created. Also more fleshed out profile and comment features adding to the social network ecosystem of the application. 

## User // user story actions
The ideal user is:
* dance music fans, djs, producers, and labels
* they are interested in archiving playlists or music theme sets, including also dj mixes
* Allow links to bandcamp similar to buymusic.club for users to share resources for other users. 
* Social aspect build out of buy music club similar to soundcloud comments and maybe in a very future build messaging and articles
